# Reconstructing Trajectories from Sensor Data (Python)
This reconstruction algorithm was developed/coded during the "Into to Self-Driving Cars"-Nanodegree program.

The task was to implement a reconstruction algorithm, that recontructs the trajectories from sensor data (timestamp, displacement, yaw rate, acceleration).
This includes the usage of derivatives, integrals and trigonometry in code.

## How to run the code?

  1. Download the files;
  2. Run main.py in terminal
  3. See the resulting trajectories
